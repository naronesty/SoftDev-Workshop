We opened the file and we read it into a dictReader (an iterable dictionary-ish object). 
We then separated the keys and values into two lists and removed the last line ("Total: 99.8").
Finally, we used `random.choices()`. 
This took the keys and values, and read the values as percent chances to get their repective keys and choose one using a weighted randomized selcection algorithm.
