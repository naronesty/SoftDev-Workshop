We ran the command in the terminal and it seemed like nothing happened.
BUT!! Then we went to the home directory and cded into the new myherozero
folder that was created. We found 3 folders and a pyvenv.cfg file.

We opened the pyvenv.cfg file and it gave a route to the home 
python directory. It also tells us the version of python that we're 
using and unincludes system packages.

Noakai told us that when he uses pycharm it
automatically creates a venv file to set up.

We googled venv in python and looked at documentation. It told us
that venv creates a virtual environment at your specified path.
In a virtual environment, libraries used are separately so you 
can download different things.

We looked at the bin folder, which has normal python dependencies.
We looked in the include folder and saw that it was empty. We 
assumed that this might be for the user to include specialized stuff.
