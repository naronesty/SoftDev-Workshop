Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?

In a lot of other languages- particularly python, where a variable
is set to the output of a function.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
It is the separator in paths in the terminal. In this case it means 
that there is no specific path after the file name past localhost or
whatever the name of the site is.

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
This will print to the inspect element console on the website.

EDIT: it prints to the terminal that is running python3 app.py.
- we switched it to print "hey" instead of __name__
- __name__ prints __main__ 
- we googled it and __name__ in python is defaulted
to main, but if a file is being imported, it is not main 
anymore. It can check what script is being run.

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
This will appear on the main screen of the site because we
assumed that upon the app running all the functions get run 
too (because there's no main).

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
In java when you run methods from specific objects, you call them by
typing object.method(), just like this. For ex. arraylist.size()
