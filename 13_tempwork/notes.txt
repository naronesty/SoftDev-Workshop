K13 --  making our own flask website that also relies on html from K11 and html template found in K12
2021-10-08

The {{}} notation is used to  declare a variable in the html template, which can be defined in the app.py render_template() function from flask. The {%%} notation,
on the other hand, allows you to use primitive functions in the html template and also define local variables to be used in those functions.

Separating code into many funcs is good
