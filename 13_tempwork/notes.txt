K13 --  making our own flask website that also relies on html from K11 and html template found in K12
2021-10-08

The {{}} notation is used to  declare a variable in the html template, which can be defined in the app.py render_template() function from flask. The {%%} notation,
on the other hand, allows you to use primitive functions in the html template and also define local variables to be used in those functions.

Separating code into many funcs is good

EGO
The practice of egoless programming is a good one; claiming ownership over code leads to a wounding of pride when errors are found. This impedes progress, as it is
better to just fix the errors and move on. A social environment is important in computer programming, because it improves each involved person's skills, and claiming
ownership/not allowing people to double check code you have written destroys the environment.

egoless programming = chill programming
