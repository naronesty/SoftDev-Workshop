K14 -- Form and Function
2021-10-14

Predictions:
-When you run the flask application, it will open the root directory function disp_loginpage.
We think that this will display the template with the HTML form and you will be prompted to
submit information and also print the request for input in the console. We assume it will
display the loginpage as named by the function.
-When you submit the username, we will see waaaa hooo haaa as it is displayed in
the auth directory.

Results:
-When we ran it we were prompted to enter a username and once we did we were taken to the
auth page.
-The console initially prints the request args as an empty immutable dictionary, but then
once we inputted information, the immutable dictionary fills with the information we inputted.
-When we tried to mess around with get and post, get gave us our webpage and there was stuff
behind the initial URL. When we tried post, after we typed the username we were not able to access
the webpage.
