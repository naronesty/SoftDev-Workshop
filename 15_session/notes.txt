K15 -- Sessions Greetings

Coding Process Notes
- What does create a session where username is stored mean?
- As expected, we could take request.args and use conditionals to hard code certain passwords
- What other request types are there?
- It took us a couple minutes to figure out how to change the name on the button for logout button
- How do we make an if statement in HTML to make it so our error message template isn't always noticable in our login screen?

Dev Console Notes
- All the html in the login page is shown when the website is first viewed
- Some bodies are collapsed and can be opened with drop-down arrows (eg. `<body>...</body>`, `<head>...</head>`, `<form>...</form>`)
- Interestingly (though definitely fortunately) all documentation and comments are shown
- The html is automatically indented and formatted so it is easy to read in the dev console, even if it is not in the <template>.html
