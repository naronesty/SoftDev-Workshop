Coding Process Notes
- What does create a session where username is stored mean?
- As expected, we could take request.args and use conditionals to hard code certain passwords
- What other request types are there?
- It took us a couple minutes to figure out how to change the name on the button for logout button
- How do we make an if statement in HTML to make it so our error message template isn't always noticable in our login screen?
