Coding Process Notes
- What does create a session where username is stored mean?
- As expected, we could take request.args and use conditionals to hard code certain passwords
- What other request types are there?
- It took us a couple minutes to figure out how to change the name on the button for logout button
- How do we make an if statement in HTML to make it so our error message template isn't always noticable in our login screen?

Browser Debug Page (Inspect Element)
- Find Cookies (chrome) by going to "Application -> Cookies" and check dropdown
- All the html in the login page is shown when the website is first viewed
  - Some bodies are collapsed and can be opened with drop-down arrows (eg. ```<body>...</body>```, ```<head>...</head>```, ```<form>...</form>```)
  - Interestingly (and definitely fortunately) all documentation and comments are shown
  - The html is automatically indented and formatted so it is easy to read in the dev console, even if it is not in the <template>.html

Dev Console
- Tells you whether GET or POST was used
- Shows the url of the reested page, excluding the localhost
- GET requests for routes other than the default "/" route are highlighted and show the full url including the extra GET characters
