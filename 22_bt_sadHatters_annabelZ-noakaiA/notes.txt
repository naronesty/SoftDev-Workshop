- Very convenient to be able to access a lot of classes and features using just a few imported links
- Because there are so many classes, it doesn't feel that much easier than just using css, but it looks a lot better
- Many features are made a lot easier like text alignment and keeping a consistent distance from screen edges
- Better default fonts
- Annoyingly limited number of container colors in default package
- Make everything an alert, they look the best and allow for more container colors
- Put everything in a container for screen edge distances
