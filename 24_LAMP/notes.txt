Chose the Ubuntu OS
Used the same ssh key as my Github one
Basic plan
The "create droplet" button seems so inviting but I'm scared it'll charge me.
  -Tbh I'm more worried about Mykolyk's command to *not spend any money!* than the 5 dollars/month
  
Well I clicked it and it worked and the "Estimated Costs", which shows the amount of money I owe is still 0.00$ so we good.
Easy interface and access to root console
Droplet came with the right Ubuntu version already installed so I don't need to figure that out.

I just looked up how to install apache2 from the terminal and was given:
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install apache2`
It seemed to work without breaking anything so yay.

Also people told me to run
`apt upgrade`
because it would update my programs and it also seemed to not break anything. Cool

Well I looked at some guides and I need to have a user (shush).
I used "rebuild droplet" to reset the droplet. I don't know if this was needed but sure.



Works now, nice.
