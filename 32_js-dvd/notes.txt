K32 -- canvas based JS animation now with DVD
2022-02-17

- Wrapper function for drawDVD was useful for randomizing the DVD logo's position on button click.
- Did not need to change animation cancelation properties of the draw() functions because there is only one animation frame active at a time
- Image() will create an image with no properties
- drawImage() actually renders the image with dimentions, the image object itslef can have dimentions, but they are overriden by drawImage()
